# DBM-Points-System
  Hi everyone, Recently, I saw a lot of users asking for a points system with a gambling system. So, I decided to publish the system I did a while ago, at the beginning of my way in DBM.  The Project Includes: ↦ Cash System: Every message that member sends in the server he receive 1 cash. He also can check how many cash he has by typing: !cash. Further more, he can check how many cash there is to some member by typing: !cash &lt;@MentionMember> Members can send cash to other members by the command: !transfer &lt;@MentionMember> Be careful, There is tax that takes 10% from the amount, but Premium members enjoy from NON-Tax. ↦ Gambling System: By typing: !gamble The bot generate number and check if the member won or lose. In the Gamble system moderators with Kick Members permission can block member from gambling and then he can't gamble. They also can unblock the member: !blockgamble &lt;@MentionMember> || !unblockgamble &lt;@MentionMember>  ↦ Points Leader Board: By typing !moneyboard you can see who is the most rich man in town.  ↦ COMING SOON: Edit Cash command for moderators.
